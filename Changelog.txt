Added Suppressed Pistol and Copper Bullets

Currently The plan is for all suppressed weapons to be aquired after one mech boss has been defeated:
Pistol after any mech boss
AR after destroyer
SMG after Skeletron Prime
Sniper after Twins

The reason coppper bullets are being added is to give an ammo to early game guns without the need for the arms dealer

Changes:
Resprited the Exotic Burst Pulse Rifle to Look more like the Fortnite Model, Removed the exotic outline for aesthetic purposes

Drum Gun now has a 25% chance to not consume ammo

Suppressed Assault Rifle now requires 10 souls of might
